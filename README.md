# Requirements:
- At least two classes (i.e. Board and Player)
- Randomization

# Goals:
1. Find assets (i.e. pictures, sounds, etc)
2. ~~Have a working GUI skeleton by 9/23~~
3. Functional classes by 9/25

# Ideas:
- Create 2 `Player` objects and put them in `Players` array/list have the Game class switch players by referring to indices
- add a `string name` to the `Player` class and allow players to enter their names
